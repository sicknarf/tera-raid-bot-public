## how to use

Once you are all set up, using it is pretty straightforward. Just start with `/host`.

1. Type `/host` to start the bot

2. Enter the Pokémon that you are raiding, the tera type, and how many stars this raid is.

3. The post has been made! If there is a chance of each flavor of Herba Mystica to drop, the post will be marked as such.

4. Other trainers can now click ✅ to join the raid! Once it is full, the button will become unclickable.

5. If someone changes their mind and can no longer do the raid, just click ⬅️, and this message will display:

6. Once you are ready (you don't need to wait for 4 people), click START and it will ping everyone to get ready! Then send over the link code!

7. If for any reason you can no longer start the raid, simply click 🛑.

If you are worried about non-hosts trying to start and cancel the raid, this has already been accounted for:
