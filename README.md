## how to use

Once you are all set up, using it is pretty straightforward. Just start with `/host`.

1. Type `/host` to start the bot

3. The post has been made! If there is a chance of each flavor of Herba Mystica to drop, the post will be marked as such.

4. Other trainers can now click ‚úÖ to join the raid! Once it is full, the button will become unclickable.

5. If someone changes their mind and can no longer do the raid, just click ‚¨ÖÔ∏è, and this message will display:

6. Once you are ready (you don't need to wait for 4 people), click START and it will ping everyone to get ready! Then send over the link code!

If you are worried about non-hosts trying to start and cancel the raid, this has already been accounted for:
